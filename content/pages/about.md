# About Me

Hi, I'm **Volkan Çiçek** — a Senior Data Scientist based in Istanbul, Turkey.

I have a Mathematics background and 4+ years of experience designing scalable AI solutions. Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at Gebze Technical University.

## What I Do

I work at the intersection of **Generative AI**, **LLMs**, **RAG systems**, and **MLOps** — turning complex AI ideas into production-ready solutions.

At [Logo Yazılım](https://www.logo.com.tr/), I lead initiatives in:

- **Generative AI** — Intelligent chatbots, text-to-SQL engines, RAG systems
- **AIOps** — Anomaly detection and forecasting on large-scale time-series data
- **MLOps** — End-to-end ML pipelines from prototype to production
- **Computer Vision** — OCR pipelines, real-time video analysis

## Tech Stack

**AI & ML:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, LlamaIndex, HuggingFace Transformers

**Cloud & MLOps:** Azure ML, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Airflow, MLflow

**Languages:** Python, SQL

## Writing

This blog is where I share thoughts on AI, machine learning, and software engineering — lessons learned, experiments, and things I find interesting.
